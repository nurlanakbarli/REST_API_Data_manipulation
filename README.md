# Data Extraction and Update with PostgreSQL via REST API

This project is a Python script that interacts with a PostgreSQL and Clickhouse database using REST APIs to:

Retrieve the structure of the Data Model (e.g., table names, column types) from the database.
Generate CSV files containing the new data for each table.
Push the generated CSV files back into the database.
